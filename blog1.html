            <h1>DNS</h1>
            <p>When you want to visit a website (For ex: amazon.com).
                Your browser does not understand the domain name ,  it understand IP address.
                So,DNS converts this domain name to IP Address.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/Capture.PNG" alt="">
            <p>It does it by using DNS resolver.
                DNS resolver is generally confgured with 1.1.1.1 (which is cloudflare DNS)
                So, browser asks DNS resolver  :Do you have IP Address 59.192.183.86:443?
                DNS resolver:No,but I know an IP Address which has that IP Address(For ex:59.192.109.34:443)
                Then ,browser navigates to that IP Address and you get your desired Amazon.com.

            <h1>HTTP</h1>
            <p>HTTP stands for hyperText transfer protocol.
                It is a set of rules that both client and sever follows to establish a connection between them.
                When you enter a website URL , browser(Client)  sends a HTTP request to server on which website is hosted.
                Then server sends a HTTP response to the browser.Then we can see the required website.

        <p>Status codes are basically part of the HTTP response send by the server.
            It is divided into  five  categories 
            Status code from 100-199 are the informational response by the server.
            Status code from 200-299 denotes that request is well understood by the server .Then server processes
            this request and sends the desired  resources.
            Status code from 300-399 denotes that the request is unsecure ,then the server will automatically redirect it secure URL.
            Status code from 400-499 denotes that there is error in the HTTP request made by the browser.
            Status code from 500-599 denotes that there is error in the server.
